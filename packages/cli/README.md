# pistead

Connect your Linux or WSL2 Pi host to a [Pistead](https://pistead.com) workspace. The connector uses outbound WebSocket only; no inbound port or tunnel is needed.

## Requirements

- Linux or WSL2 (native Windows is unsupported)
- Node.js 24 or newer
- Pi configured locally with the providers and models you want to offer
- `bubblewrap`, Python 3, Git and `flock` (util-linux)

## Usage

In Pistead, open **Connections**, choose a workspace and create a pairing code. Then run, on the Pi host:

```sh
npx pistead@latest connect --server https://pistead.com --pairing-id PAIRING_ID
```

Enter the single-use code when prompted; it is never accepted as an argument. Later runs reuse the private saved connector token:

```sh
npx pistead@latest connect
```

Run `npx pistead connect --help` for all options.

Model credentials stay in Pi on your host. Pairing keeps the host private to you; sharing it with a workspace is a separate, explicit action in the web app.

## macOS and hosts without bubblewrap

The isolated sandbox needs Linux. On macOS, or Linux without bubblewrap, you can opt out of isolation:

```sh
npx pistead@latest connect --unsafe-no-sandbox
```

This needs only Python 3 and Git (on macOS: `xcode-select --install`). The connector prints the risks and asks you to type `unsandboxed` before starting:

- Approved shell commands and commits run directly as your user, with access to your files, credentials (`~/.ssh`, cloud and Git config, Pi's auth) and network, and no CPU, memory or disk limits.
- File tools are confined to each session folder by path checks only.
- Anyone you share the Pi with, and anyone granted approve permission on a session that runs on it, can cause approved commands to run on your machine.

Every command still needs an exact human approval, and Pistead labels the host **Unsandboxed** to everyone who can see it.
